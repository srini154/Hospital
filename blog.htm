          increase body temperature or due to restricted mobility to conserve
          energy which allows accumulation of inflammatory markers or toxins in
          joints. This leads to stiffness and pain in joints. Ignoring problems
          related to bones and joints which can lead to further deterioration.

        <h4>IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP IN BRAIN HEALTH</h4>
        <p>
          Those mood swings are for real…. Your brain regulates the hormones and
          the neurotrasnmitters. These chemicals are basically responsible for
          the way you feel. Chemical compounds like dopamine, serotonin,
          oxytocin help us feeling good, happy and upbeat. Sleep plays an
          important role in their regulation. Lack of sleep can make you
          irritated, impulsive and angry. The moments when you over react and
          have an outburst are more likely to happen when you have not slept
          well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lack of sleep makes you slow. Sleep deprivation slows down the brain’s
          ability to react quickly. Tired drivers and pilots tend to have more
          accidents and that is a well known fact. Sleep deprivation slows down
          the brain akin to getting drunk. Just like you should not be driving
          under the influence of alcohol the same applies to sleep deprivation.
